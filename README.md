1. This is a Project by Thomas Mosley (Kaitlyn)
2. I am trying to build an app that generates a mandelbrot set as a desktop background in a given color, then saves it to a file
4. this will take knowledge of complex numbers, and will require me to implement them into java. additionally, I will have to learn how to save images with javaFX and if necessary, learn OpenGL to save it instead. I estimate no more than three weeks will be enough time to complete this project
